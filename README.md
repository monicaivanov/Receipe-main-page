## Overview
A simple but fun project with lots of tiny changes in the design as you create properties for the doc elements. It was not difficult but it required some research to find the solution.

## My process
I start with creating the wireframe of the HTML doc, plan my semantic elements and I style it from bigger blocks to smaller elements, top to bottom. I try to use relative elements as much as possible to have a responsive outcome.  

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project was a good practice for the lists and table properties. 

### Continued development

I try to learn to be simple and more efficient in code. 

### Useful resources

I used no resources for this project except of the usual w3school search for properties.
